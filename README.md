## About me :link: [Blog](https://monadplus.pro/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monadplus), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnau-abella/)

I am proficient in many functional programming languages but my best is **haskell**.

I am comfortable with **algorithms, combinatorial problems, advanced data structures, concurrency, parallelism, low-level programming and a bit of math (probability, statistics, linear algebra, type theory, etc.)**.

I enjoy working on **compilers** and programming languages.
