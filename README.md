Hi, I am Arnau:

- :technologist: **Software engineer/Computer scientist**.
- :earth_africa: **Spain**.

### About me

I am currently studying a [Msc. in Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/curriculum/specializations/advanced-computing) at [UPC](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/).

I am proficient in many functional programming languages but my best is **haskell**.

I am confortable with **algorithms, combinatorial problems, advanced data structures, concurrency, parallelism, low-level programming and a bit of math (probability, statistics, linear algebra, type theory ...)**.

I enjoy working on **compilers** and programming languages.
