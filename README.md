Welcome üòÅ
==========

Hi, I am Arnau:

- :technologist: I am a software engineer.
- :link: [My website](https://monadplus.pro/)
- :scroll: [My CV](https://monadplus.pro/assets/documents/cv2019.pdf) (a bit outdated)
- :earth_africa: Based in :es: (barcelona) but willing to relocate.

### About me

I am currently studying a [Msc. in Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/curriculum/specializations/advanced-computing) at [UPC](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/).

I am proficient in many functional programming languages but my best is **haskell**.

I am confortable with complex algorithm, combinatorial problems, advanced data structures, concurrency, parallelism, low-level programming and a bit of math (probability, statistics, linear algebra, type theory ...).

I enjoy working on compilers and programming languages.

### Open Source

- [rbst](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rbst) - Efficient implementation of Randomized Binary Search Trees in Haskell
- [equality](https://github.com/monadplus/equality) - Diff of arbitrary ADTs with nice visual representation
- [python-nix](https://github.com/monadplus/python-nix) - Easy integration of Vim and Nix for Python hacking
